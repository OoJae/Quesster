## 📱 How to Run Locally

### Prerequisites
* Node.js v18+
* Yarn
* A Supabase project

### 1. Clone & Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/OoJae/Quesster.git
cd mobile-app/packages/react-app
yarn install
```

### 2. Environment Variables
Create a .env.local file in packages/react-app:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### 3. Run Development Server
```bash
yarn dev
```

### 4. Test in MiniPay (using Ngrok)
Since MiniPay requires a secure HTTPS connection, run Ngrok in a separate terminal:
```bash
ngrok http 3000
```

Paste the resulting URL into the MiniPay Developer Settings → "Load Test Page".

### 🗄️ Backend Schema (Supabase)
Table: questions
```bash
create table questions (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  question_text text not null,
  options jsonb not null,
  correct_answer text not null,
  difficulty text default 'easy', -- 'easy' or 'hard'
  active boolean default true
);
```

Table: profiles
```bash
create table profiles (
  wallet_address text primary key,
  score int8 default 0,
  current_streak int8 default 0,
  last_played_at timestamptz default now()
);
```
### 🔮 Future Roadmap

* **Automated Payouts**: Chainlink Automation to distribute daily rewards at 00:00 UTC.
* **Badge Levels**: Upgradeable NFTs based on streak milestones.
* **Team Battles**: Multiplayer mode where squads pool funds to answer together.
